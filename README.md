A .Net standard nuget library that implements NOAA's cliamte Data Online REST api

This was not sponsor nor maintained by NOAA. I wanted to see how much effort it was to take a REST inteface and create a usuable nuget package.  This turned out to take me only a day to implement the basics.

Here are some helpful links:

* [Dataset help](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets#NORMAL_DLY)
* [My developer notes](Developer.md) to help explain how this nuget package was developed.
* [Main Climate Data Online (cdo) website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)
* [NOAA's cdo Documentation](http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation)
* [NOAA's cdo Api](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2) which is what I implemented.
* [OpenApi json file](swagger.json)
* [OpneApi yaml file](swagger.yaml)
